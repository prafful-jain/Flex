            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user’s behavior and environment based on screen size, platform, and orientation.
              <br><br>  Responsive web design (RWD) is a modern web design approach that creates dynamic changes to the appearance of a website and adjusts the content websites and webpages to automatically render (or display) on all devices or screen sizes, whether it’s a desktop, laptop, tablet, or smartphone and provides an optimal viewing experience.

                of the rendering device.</blockquote>
